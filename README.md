# **Task 03 – Student Feedback Sentiment Analysis**

*Future Interns Data Science Internship*

---

## ⭐ **Project Overview**

This project focuses on performing **Sentiment Analysis** on student feedback using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.
The goal is to understand students’ emotions—Positive, Negative, or Neutral—based on their written feedback.

The project helps institutions improve teaching methods, course quality, and student satisfaction.

---

## 🎯 **Objectives**

* Analyze large volumes of student feedback data
* Preprocess text data using NLP techniques
* Predict sentiment using machine learning models
* Visualize sentiment distribution and word importance
* Provide actionable insights to improve educational quality

---

## 🧠 **Workflow Summary**

### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**

* Cleaning text (removing punctuation, stopwords, numbers, etc.)
* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Converting text into vectors using TF-IDF

### **2️⃣ Model Building**

* Logistic Regression
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machine (optional)

### **3️⃣ Evaluation Metrics**

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* Confusion Matrix

### **4️⃣ Visualization**

* WordCloud for common positive/negative words
* Bar charts for sentiment count
* Heatmaps for confusion matrix
